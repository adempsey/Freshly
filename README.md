Freshly is an iOS app designed to help you manage your food purchases. The app allows you to enter items purchased at the grocery store to keep track of your kitchen's contents. Once entered, the app will alert you of any items nearing their expiration dates, and can help you generate shopping lists with ease.
 
Freshly learns from your behavior, and the behavior of all its users to provide as simple an experience as possible. When you begin to enter a new item, Freshly will show suggestions based on your past shopping history. To estimate expiration dates and food groups for items, Freshly saves the attributes manually entered by users in a central database - so the more people that use the app, the smarter it gets.
